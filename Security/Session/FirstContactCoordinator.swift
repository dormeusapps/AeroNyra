//
//  FirstContactCoordinator.swift
//  Security/Session
//
//  Marries the BLE transport to the secure-session store to perform CARRIER-
//  NEUTRAL first contact.
//
//  On a new link both peers exchange prekey bundles. A deterministic tie-break
//  (the higher identity key initiates) picks exactly ONE initiator, so the two
//  sides don't both start a session at once (simultaneous initiation can cross
//  the ratchets). The initiator establishes a session from the peer's bundle;
//  the responder's session forms when it opens the first (prekey) message the
//  initiator sends, which self-identifies the sender.
//
//  CARRIER-NEUTRAL BY DESIGN: although wired to BLE here, a bundle pasted from a
//  QR code or arriving over a future internet transport enters the SAME
//  `onBundle` path. Nothing here assumes proximity, and nothing assumes a peer
//  count — sessions scale to as many peers as you meet.
//
//  THIS IS THE ACTOR↔SwiftData BOUNDARY (STEP 4). The coordinator is an `actor`
//  and NEVER touches SwiftData. Instead it EMITS `SessionEvent`s on `events`;
//  a main-actor consumer (MessageInbox) turns those into Peer / Conversation /
//  Message rows. The 33-byte libsignal identity rep stays sealed inside the
//  session store — every key that crosses this boundary is the RAW 32-byte
//  `Peer.publicKeyData` form (via store.rawPublicKey / store.peerIdentity).
//
//  PRESENCE-BY-IDENTITY (Phase 7a). The coordinator is ALSO the only place that
//  knows which ephemeral BLE link maps to which crypto identity (`linkPeers`,
//  learned from each peer's bundle). It therefore publishes a second stream —
//  `reachablePeers` — carrying the set of RAW 32-byte peer keys currently
//  reachable, computed as (live links ∩ identified links). This collapses the
//  per-role presence double-count for free: one physical peer linked over BOTH
//  GATT directions surfaces as two ephemeral ids but ONE identity, hence one
//  key. A main-actor consumer mirrors this into MeshPresence so per-conversation
//  reachability ("Direct" vs "Out of range") is finally real. Like `events`, the
//  stream is `nonisolated` + unbounded-buffered, so emissions made before the
//  consumer starts are held, not dropped.
//
//  An `actor` so its mutable link/peer state is race-free; the composition root
//  feeds it the transport's streams and consumes `events` + `reachablePeers`.
