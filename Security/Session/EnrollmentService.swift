//
//  EnrollmentService.swift
//  Security/Session
//
//  THE single owner of the live closed-contact admission set AND the single-use
//  invite ledger (STEP 7c-1 admission · 7c-2 ledger · GROUND_TRUTH §3.4/§3.5/§3.6
//  · ENROLLMENT_7c1.md · INVITE_7c2.md).
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. `ContactAllowlistStore` and `PendingInvitesStore` are both
//  WHOLE-BLOB load/save — every save writes the entire set as one sealed file. Two
//  concurrent mutations that each did load→mutate→save would race: the second
//  overwrites the first, silently dropping a contact (or an invite id) from a
//  security-relevant set with no error. This service is the one owner that
//  serializes every mutation. It is `@MainActor`, holds the live `ContactAllowlist`
//  AND the live `PendingInvites` in memory (loaded ONCE at construction), and
//  re-persists the whole blob on each mutation. Actor confinement makes
//  read-modify-write atomic; no concurrent save can race.
//
//  WRITE ORDERING — SAVE-THEN-ADOPT (decided, §3/§6 of the threat notes). Every
//  mutation: build a mutated COPY → `store.save(copy)` FIRST → only on success
//  adopt the copy as the live set → only then notify anyone downstream. If the save
//  throws, the live set, the persisted file, and any downstream state are ALL
//  unchanged, and the error propagates for the caller to retry. This guarantees the
//  live sets only ever reflect what is durably on disk.
//
//  INVITE REDEEM ORDER (INVITE_7c2.md §6). redeemEcho does consume → persist the
//  burn FIRST → adopt → THEN enroll(verified:false). A crash can never leave a
//  consumed id re-consumable, and the unverified contact only appears once the burn
//  is durable. The identity is validated BEFORE the burn, so a malformed identity
//  never spends an invite. If the (separate) allowlist save then fails, the invite
//  is spent but the contact isn't added — a wasted invite, retried with a fresh
//  one; NOT a security hole. The reverse order WOULD be one (a live, replayable
//  invite), so this ordering is deliberate.
//
//  TRANSITIONS (§4). QR pair → enroll(verified: true) (proximity authenticates).
//  Invite mint → mintInvite (no enrollment yet). Invite redeem (valid echo) →
//  enroll(verified: false) (pending the SAS). SAS match → markVerified. An invite
//  can NEVER self-verify; verified: true is only ever set by an explicit QR enroll
//  or a SAS markVerified.
//
//  SCOPE. This is the data layer of "add a contact" AND the owner of the single-use
//  invite ledger (mint/redeem, save-then-adopt against PendingInvitesStore). It
//  does NOT build pairing UI (7d), wire the echo transport (7c-2 step 5 — a sealed
//  MessagePayload routed here by MessageRouter), raise the key-change alert (7c-3),
//  or flip the admission gate (7e). Live revoke-from-reconnect is deferred (the
//  coordinator has no reconnect-removal method yet; a revoked contact stops
//  reconnecting after relaunch, authoritative at 7e).
//
