//  PTT C-3a: the listener-side AVAudioSession owner for a live walkie session.
//  This commit ships INERT: nothing constructs or calls PTTSessionOwner yet
//  (`MessageInbox.onPTTSession` stays nil; C-3b wires the composition root).
//  It holds the C-2 `PTTPlayer` and anchors the process-global audio session
//  to the wire session's lifetime, mirroring `CallEngine`'s session policy:
//  activate once at start, deactivate once at end with
//  `.notifyOthersOnDeactivation`, and a system interruption ends the spurt.
//
//  Invariants owned here (named at the enforcement sites below):
//    IC5-revised — the audio session is anchored to the WIRE session
//          (`.pttOpened`/`.pttClosed` from the coordinator), not to the cover
//          UI and not per-press. `opened(link:)`/`closed(link:)` are the ONLY
//          session-lifetime edges; half-duplex talker↔listener flips inside a
//          session never touch the session.
//    IC7 — foreground-only. No `audio` background mode exists or is added;
//          when the app backgrounds mid-session the system suspends audio and
//          the wire session dies with the link — nothing here pretends
//          otherwise.
//    IC8 — `isLive` is THE live flag: because `setActive(false)` is
//          process-global and this codebase has six uncoordinated
//          deactivation sites, every other owner's deactivation guard reads
//          this ONE property (C-3b adds the one-line guards). It is a single
//          readable choke point, never duplicated logic.
//
//  DECIDED (do not revisit): category is `.playAndRecord` + mode `.default`
//  + `[.defaultToSpeaker]` for the WHOLE session — identical to
//  `PTTCaptureEngine.start()`, so the talker↔listener flip needs no category
//  change. NOT CallEngine's `.voiceChat`, and nothing
//  `RTCAudioSession`/`useManualAudio`-shaped. No `routeChangeNotification`
//  handling in v1.
